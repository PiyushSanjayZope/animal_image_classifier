# animal_image_classifier
Data science project using deep learning for image classifier.

Overview
I have replicated this project with several variations. I referred Ken Jee YouTube video for implementing this project. Ken used the sports ball data and I have used animals images data for this project.

Resources which I used for this project-
-Data Science Project Example Start to Finish (Deep Learning Image Classifier)- https://youtu.be/vy-R4oUZaC8
-fastai lesson two notebook- https://github.com/fastai/course-v3/blob/master/nbs/dl1/lesson2-download.ipynb


Config
I recommend using google colab for this project as it makes the gpu configuration far easier. In google colab make sure that you go to runtime -> change runtime type -> gpu.

Data
I used the following chrome extension to download the data from google images. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/imageassistant-batch-imag/dbjbempljhcmhlfpfacalomonjpalpko?hl=en
